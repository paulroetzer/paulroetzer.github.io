I am a second year PhD Student supervised by <a href="https://lovc.cs.uni-bonn.de/index.php/team/florian-bernard/">Florian Bernard</a> at the University of Bonn. My research interests are geometry processing, shape analysis, correspondence problems of 2D and/or 3D shapes and optimisation methods.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence as well as my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Technical University of Munich (TUM).

Apart from researching, I spent my time with triathlon and photography.
