At this years GCPR in Munich I was invited (together with three other PhD students) to give a talk about my PhD. I spoke about "Geometric Consistency in Shape Matching".

> The shape matching problem refers to finding correspondences between two shapes. We consider 2D shapes (cyclic graphs where all vertices lie on a plane) and 3D shapes (triangles meshes in 3D space). Geometric consistency loosely defines neighbourhood preservation of correspondences between two shapes and is overlooked in many shape matching approaches as it leads to non-convex optimisation problems with a large set of constraints. Approaches which consider geometric consistency usually require specialised solvers and/or do make compromises in terms of solution quality/optimality. In this talk we learn how to use shortest paths to efficiently find geometrically consistent and globally optimal solutions for matching 2D shapes to 3D shapes and furthermore for matching two 3D shapes.
